# **Cowboy**

# Howdy y'all! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jacob, but my friends call me Cowboy ðŸ¤ .

## I'm super excited to be in college right now, currently working for a Technical Certificate in Software Application Development with the overall goal of an Associates degree in Software Engineering, Web Development, or Cloud Technologies... Decisions, decisions. I'm currently working as a forklift driver, something I have done for several years, but tech has quickly become my obsession.

## Previously I have taken a couple different coding bootcamps where I learned the [MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern/understand-mern-stack/) including [Html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and dabbled in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## I'm also reasonably comfortable using tools such as Visual Studio Code, Git, and Github. I have built a few websites, mostly as capstone projects for the bootcamps I have attended, so not much to brag about as yet. I am not great with the design aspect, although I am hopeful to develop that skill through college courses, but I find great joy in the functionality of websites, solving problems, and learning new things.
